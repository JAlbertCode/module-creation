# Model Support

This project uses a universal analyzer that automatically handles any Hugging Face model. The system adapts to:

## Input Types
- Text (prompts, documents, code)
- Images (photos, diagrams, art)
- Audio (speech, music, sounds)
- Video (clips, streams)
- Structured Data (graphs, point clouds)

## Output Types
- Text Generation
- Image Generation/Modification
- Audio Generation
- Video Generation
- Structured Data (labels, embeddings, metadata)

## Processing Types
- Generation (create new content)
- Classification (categorize input)
- Transformation (modify input)
- Feature Extraction (analyze input)

The system automatically:
1. Detects model requirements
2. Configures appropriate processors
3. Sets up runtime environment
4. Handles inputs/outputs

## Testing Coverage

We validate the universal system works with:

- Language Models (GPT, BERT, T5)
- Vision Models (ViT, YOLO, Stable Diffusion)
- Audio Models (Whisper, Bark)
- Video Models (VideoGPT)
- Multimodal Models (CLIP, BLIP)

## Adding New Models

To add a new model from Hugging Face:
```bash
python cli.py convert MODEL_ID --output ./modules
```

No additional code needed - the system automatically handles any model type.

## Implementation Status

âœ… Core Universal System:
- Model analysis
- Template generation
- File generation
- Resource management

ðŸŸ¡ In Progress:
- Testing coverage
- Performance optimization
- Resource monitoring

## Edge Cases

Some models may require special handling for:
- Custom tokenizers
- Special architectures
- Unique preprocessing
- Resource constraints

These are handled through the universal analysis system, not custom implementations.
